"_The mail is quite cheap already, why shall I use PolyPort_" is a common question, we get.

Most people argue, that a price reduction of 30-50% might not be enough to go through the trouble of taking a detour to arrange a meetup between the transporter and sender.

But those people who are concerned about additional detours usually forget about the hassles connected with **dropping or getting items from the local post office**. The average travel distance from a Swiss home to the local mail office is about 20 minutes. Attributing the average Swiss value of leisure travel time of 12CHF/h for this 40 minute round-trip, **dropping a package at the mail office costs me 8,00CHF already**. Considering that most working people are not at home during the delivery of their package, the recipient will have to make the same trip again to the mail office to finally get his package; except you have to come during working hours 7:30am-6:30pm.

If you now think about how many people live within the same 20 minute radius of your home, you have an incredible number of people to pick from. If only a fraction of these people travels close to where you need to ship to, you already found a suitable transporter. Because PolyPort relies on geo-coded data, it will only consider senders and transporters to be suitable matches if **they live reasonably close** which invalidates the detour argument.

Thus, PolyPort is a **cheap and green alternative to the mail.** In addition,  it offers flexible working hours and the opportunity to meet your **mail-man in person** and to get to know new people in your community.

If this does not convince you: the national mail and co are facing great challenges to maintain their physical infrastructure (e.g. local offices and vehicle fleet) and to pay the energy costs to keep the system running. Innovative, ecological approaches for distribution systems are of extreme importance to these logistics companies. By participating in PolyPort you can help to **develop and test new prototypes for possible crowd sourced logistics systems** for our future and to contribute to the **sustainability of your direct environment.**
