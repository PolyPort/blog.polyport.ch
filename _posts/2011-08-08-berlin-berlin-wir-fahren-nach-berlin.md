The PolyPort co-founders have officially graduated and have opened up their Berlin headquarter.

Our current office is at FU Berlin in Dahlem. It's about 30 minute train ride from the city center and right next to the Botanical garden and multiple embassies. So definitely not the worst place to be.

but we are not only enjoying the summer time and free office space... as you can see, we are working hard after all ;)
