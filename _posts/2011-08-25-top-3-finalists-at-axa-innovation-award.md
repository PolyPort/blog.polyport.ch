Today, Philipp and Stella travelled to Winterthur to pitch as 1 of 5 selected teams at the AXA Innovation Award.
Originally more than 110 teams had applied to participate and get the chance to win 75.000CHF, founding capital and support in setting up the insurance for the company.

Among Diamond Heels, importing fair trade customizable high heels, and a startup with the goal to monitor energy consumption of industrial plants more efficiently, PolyPort made the final cut!

All finalists made a short movie about their project. Below you can see us sweating in front of the camera lights.
We will post the video soon :)

The winner of the award will be announced September 23rd.
