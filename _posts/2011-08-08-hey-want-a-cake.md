It's so hard to give things to people for free... even if you have a basket of yummy snacks and drinks right next to you to offer.

Even harder:try to engage people in a conversation! 

Our first experience with customer surveys last month was really a life lesson learned:
1. don't try to engage customers right behind the checkout
-->if the service customer manager tells you to, try to convince him otherwise:people will just RUN
2. fill up their free time in the queue or at the bus stop = MUCH BETTER

On average you might get
-1 person to talk to you and give sensible answer every 5 minutes
= 12 people per hour
= 6 hours - (1 hour of breaks and lunch) = ca. 60 people in a day!

So please,
BE NICE whenever someone tries to ask you some questions,
HIS JOB is dam HARD
