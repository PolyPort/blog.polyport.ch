It's so hard to give things to people for free... even if you have a basket of yummy snacks and drinks right next to you, to offer.

Even harder: try to engage people in a conversation!

Our first experience with customer surveys last month was really a life lesson learned:

1. don't try to engage customers right behind the checkout
-->if the service customer manager tells you to, try to convince him otherwise: people will just RUN
2. fill up their free time in the queue or at the bus stop = MUCH BETTER

On average you might get 1 person to talk to you and give sensible answer every 5 minutes = 12 people per hour. So that makes 6 hours - (1 hour of breaks and lunch) = approx. 60 people in a day!

So please, BE NICE whenever someone tries to ask you some questions, HIS JOB is damn HARD.
